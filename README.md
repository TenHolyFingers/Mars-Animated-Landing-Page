# Mars-Animated-Landing-Page
This project is a visually stunning and interactive landing page about Mars exploration. It features a dynamic space-themed background, smooth animations, and a sleek UI designed to engage users in the possibility of human life on Mars. The page includes an animated Mars, responsive design, and an intuitive navigation system that allows users to explore different sections like Info, Projects, and the Launch Schedule.

Built using HTML5 and CSS3, the design leverages CSS animations to create a modern and immersive experience. The use of Nunito and Poppins fonts enhances the futuristic look, while the smooth transitions and interactive elements make it engaging.
